We record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily
determinable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and
represent $5.9 billion and $7.8 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. A
hypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2021 balance, which could be experienced in the near
term, would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $780 million. From time to time, we may enter
into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.
Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for
observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the
measurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an
indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the
early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are
typically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition,
which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The success of our investment
in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of
investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. As of
December 31, 2020 and 2021, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for
under the measurement alternative, was $18.9 billion and $27.6 billion, respectively.
