Our Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and
maintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including those of the U.S. government and its agencies,
corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time
deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount
of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities
carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a
rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall.
Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared
to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair
value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We measure securities for
which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities
are sold, less any expected credit losses.
