We transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses
denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the
U.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and
Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in

foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange
rates of 10% could be experienced in the near term.
We use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do
not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign
currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset
by the gains and losses on the forward contracts.
If an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and
commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have
resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $497 million and $285 million as of
December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for
the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.
